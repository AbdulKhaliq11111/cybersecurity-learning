# Cybersecurity Learning Log

Hi, I’m Mohammed Abdul Khaliq.  
I’m a B.Tech graduate building strong fundamentals in cybersecurity through consistent, hands-on practice.

This repository is my personal cybersecurity learning log.  
It documents what I actually study, practice, and understand — day by day.

My immediate goal is to secure a paid cybersecurity internship or entry-level role where I can apply my fundamentals in a real working environment.  
Long-term, I aim to grow into higher-responsibility and higher-impact roles in the cybersecurity field.

## Why This Repository Exists

I maintain this repository to:

- Track my daily learning and technical progress  
- Build strong fundamentals before moving into advanced security topics  
- Stay consistent and disciplined in my learning  
- Demonstrate real effort and understanding, not just certificates  

This repository reflects how I learn, how I think, and how seriously I take building a career in cybersecurity.
