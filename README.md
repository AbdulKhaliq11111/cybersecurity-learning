Cybersecurity Learning Log

Hi, I’m Mohammed Abdul Khaliq.
I’m a B.Tech graduate currently building my foundation in cybersecurity through consistent, hands-on practice.

This repository is a personal learning log. It exists to document what I actually study and practice on a daily basis.
My immediate goal is to secure a paid cybersecurity internship or entry-level role. Long-term, I aim to grow into higher-responsibility and higher-impact roles in the cybersecurity field.

Everything written here reflects work I have already completed.
